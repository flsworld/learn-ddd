"""
Here stands the service layer, which serve as the entrypoint to the domain model. An abstraction to capture the use
case and that will sit between FastAPI and the domain model. Its job is to handle requests from the outside world and
to orchestrate an operation. This is separated from business logic and helps keeping things tidy.

Orchestration layer or a use-case layer :
* fetching stuff out of the repository
* validating the input against database state
* handling errors
* update the domain model
* committing in the happy path - persisting any changes
Things that could be related to an API, CLI or tests !

Using primitive data types allows the service layerâ€™s clients (tests and FastAPI) to be decoupled from the model
layer. If the domain model is refactored, this will have no impact on the orchestration layer.
